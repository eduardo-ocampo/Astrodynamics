## Introduction

Aerodynamics decelerators are 

parachutes are the work horse of aerodynamic decelerators. Although there has been a lot of work developing new technolgoes like inflatable aerodynamics declerations and depolyable aero deceleators. 

Where the parachutes come in is the terminal descent phases ADD FIGURE which typically begin as supersonic speeds and typically with a deployalb aero declerator. 

Whether it's Earth, Venus or Mars Entries, the terminal deccent pahse begins at supersonic speeds and typicall with a deployable aerodynamic decelato such as a parachtues. Because a parachtues is deployable it's able to encmpoass a really large area thus a lot of drag from the atmosphere. The advantage of a deployable aero declerato is when it is packaged inside the entry vehicle it occupies very little volume and realtievel low mass becuase it is usally made out of textile. So the really beneift why engineers use parachutes is becaued they give you a ton of drag and they weight amost nothing and take up little space. 

Following supersonic descent the approach to deceleator depends on the atmosphere. For a thick atomsphere like Earth or Titan you can actually use a decelarto all the way throught the subsonic phase. For a atmosphere which is thin like Mars for example you usally cannot get awy with using a decelerator because the are required to slow down would be too large to make any sense. Instead a retroprop sysetm is used to provide to reduce your remaning delta V.

## Parachutes Functions

Parachutes have several functions, as dsicuss one of them is basic decleration in the super/sub sonic regim. While at the same time, they can provide very specific control descent rate. By providng a strong drag force opposite to the direciton of the motion towards the planet they provide stabilty and control such as orienting of locking a radar to the ground or preparing for landing. You can also deploy a larger parchatue or to deploy another device (pilot vs main parachutes). ANother reason to use a parachtes is if you have devies which are speeration from each other and you want to chagne the ballsitic coeffeiciton to make it much less than the ballistic coefftion than the thing that is seperating. For hear sheild spereation events having a parachtues on the back shell side will allow the heat shield to speratre more easlily. Larger drag area for roughtly the same mass means lower ballistic coeffecitient. 

TODO Add Anatomy of a Parachute Figure, see page 7

Every parachtue typically will ahve a vent at the top. The disk-gap-band helps for airflow during supersonic conditions. Parachure projected diameter $D_p$ is the diameter looking into the parachture. The contrsutied diameter is the the parameter of most interest, it is the diameter you would get if parachtues is laid flat on a surface and made a big circle. Suspension lines have a length assocaite with it. The longer they are the more uniform the canopy is at the top and the longer the distance between the entry vehicle and the opening of the canopy. Not a lot of fluid can entery the canopy if the suspsension line lenght is really small. The longer the suspsension line lenght hte longer the trailing distance which results in better drag performance.

## System Sizing

The primary  paramterse that you care about are the drag performance that you want, the structural requirements (peak load), and stability. Other considerationa re how to deploy the parachute, how long it takes and how to make sure it infaltes repeatedly. Cost and manufaturability is very important and the mass is important because it is part of your enery system mass. Materials compaitiblity is really importnat becauess every planet has a different atmosphere, different properites. For example, Venus EDL there is a region of the atmosphere where the aprachtue descednt does occur and their is sulfuric acid which can deteriamte certain materials. 

The driving equation is drag force, and understanignt the requiremetns for drag force is often times drive by terminal velocity. 

Peak load is driven by your drag coeff and driven velocity for which you are fully inflated. The peak load maybe when opening or later on when reefing a parachtue or load cycles from collapsing and inflating a parachutes. LINK Reefing and cycles. 

The general trend. if you want to increaes the drag you decrease stability so you need to make the trade off or optimize the parachute design. 

### Parchture Selection:

$C_{D0}$ refers to the drag coefficient of the parachute. How does parachture design affect C_D0? Increasing suspension lines length increaes C_D0 due ot the canopy being able to open up more thus larger area. Typically when you increase trailing distance, distance between parachture and suspended mass you can increaes drag coeff. That is becuase there a blockage from the entry capusle when the trailing distance is small due to wake effects on the parachute which reduces drag coeff. If you have a larger capsule diameter as compared to parachture opening diameter you will get reduced drag simialiar as you are blockign fluding flowing into the canopy. 

TOOD: Maybe find figure from book to match text

### Ballistic Coeff Ratio

Ballistic coeff is improatnt when sizing a parachtuer beacaue often times a parachture is used to enable seperation of differnt devices. Want to understand the ballistic of parachtuere hodling somethign and what is dropeed so that they dont collide. In general design for a  ratio of 0.70 of ballistic coeffe between stages and track trajectory of seperable objects during flight when possible. 

### Trailing Distance

In almost every sceniar your parachtue is going to be deplyed in the wake of you aeroshell which is a bluff body. Therefore understanding how the parachture is going to interact wwith the wake is imporatnt. As a rule of thumb design parachtuere 10 forebody diameter behind your forebody to prevent wake presuure coupling. 

### Atmospheric Density

When you have a parchteu fully infalted the mass of air inside of that acts as a body. When you take into consider the capusle dyanmics and parachtue dynamics that has an effect on flight dynamics. 

The drag coeffient of the parahctuer is a function of its mach number. This PLOT shows how the drag coeff varies for a parachtuer when it doesn't have a aeroshell in front of it when testd in a wind tunnel (RED). When adding 

see better perforamce subsonic, worst perforamnce in transonic regim, and increasingly worst peformance as you increase mach number. When you add the wake of the aeroshell (Black) you get even furhter reduced drage coeffcient. For trajector simualti we will use black curve cauase that is representative. 

### Inflation

One of hte biggest chanelleges is understanign how the parachutes is going to inflate. The reason for this is that it is a funciton of descent speed, the aerodynamic environemt, and atmospheric properties. The reason why this matters if you were to deploy a parachture of Earth the density is pretty high. As it is opeing up and inflating it is slowing down and will experience its full load when its partially inflated, Where as if youwere to deploy on Mars where the density is very low it actually doesn't expeienc that much drag when inflating so that it actually expeiences its full load when it's fully infalted. The reason why this matters is that structually you need to desing for a worst case load and pressure distrubiton which is oging to look diffreent if you are partial inflated vs fully infalted. Thus you can never ever match the combiant of shpae as well as load condition in an Earth based test. That's the reason there is an infinite mass inflation test/simulation

### Materials 

What the highest strenght to weight. Other things to consider is dureing transit the amterial will be expose to UV and a vacuum environment. The material must be able to handle thermal pressure packing. They often times to have to be able to handle high tempearure pressure packing to remove living organisism. At the same time, the melting temp of these materials is important as you will be in high mach number reigim. When these depolyment happen things come out really quickly so you want to choose a material to avoid frction burns. Often a teflon filmis used as a low-frction liner.

## Terminal Descent 

Let us make some assumptiohs that allows us to write the equations of motion in a way that will alllow to integrate numerically. 

1. No wind force
2. Ignore system oscillations
3. Atmospheric Density Approximation TODO LINK BALLSITIC COEFF SECTION

From FBD (TODO Make figure like lectures notes) the equations of motion for descent of EV is:

:::{math}   
:label: terminal_descent_eom_raw
m_{ev}g - \left( F_{d,p} + F_{d,ev} \right) = m_{ev} \frac{dV}{dt}
:::

Where drag is not a funciton of speed and the force ($F_d$) is defined as:

:::{math}
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_{D} S
:::

Note use contrusted diameter for parachtue (d_0) and maximum diameter of the aeroshell for th entry vehilce. 

Express {eq}`terminal_descent_eom_raw` in terms of vehicle parameters:

:::{math}
:label: terminal_descent_eom
m_{ev} - \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 \left(C_{D,p}S_{p} + C_{D,ev} S_{ev} \right) = m \frac{dV}{dt}
:::

Kinematics

:::{math}
:label:
V = -\frac{dH}{dt}
:::

The only thing to do now is solve for V using fininte differencing. Define initial time $t_i$ and time step as $t_{i+1} = t_i + \delta(t)$. Let $V_i$ and $h_i$ be the velocity and altitude at time $t_i$ and $V_{i+1}$ and $h_{i+1}$ be the velocity and altitude at  time $t_{i+1}$. We can re-write our equaitons of tmotins {eq}`terminal_descent_eom` approximately as: 

:::{math}
:label:
m_{ev}g - \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 e^{-Ah_i} V^{2}_{i} \left(C_{D,p}S_P + C_{D,eve}S_{ev} \right) = m \frac{V_{i+1}-V_{i}}{\delta t}
:::

Solving this equation for V_{i+1}:

:::{math}
:label:
V_{i+1} = V_i + \left[g - \frac{1}{2m_{ev}}\rho_0 e^{-Ah_i} V^{2}_{i} \left(C_{D,p}S_P + C_{D,eve}S_{ev} \right) \right]\delta t
:::

Similary for the kinematic equation
:::{math}
:label:
V_i = -\frac{h_{i+q}-h_i}{\delta t}
:::

Sovling for $h_{i+1}$
:::{math}
:label:
h_{i+1} = h_i - V_i \delta t
:::
