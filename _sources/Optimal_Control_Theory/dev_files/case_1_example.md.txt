### Case 1

Consider the case which the river has no current.

:::{math}
:label: zerm_case1_current
U\left(x,y\right) = 0
:::

The dynamics is simply driven by the boat {eq}`zermo_dynamics` becomes:

:::{math}
:label: zerm_case1_boat
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= V\cos{\delta} \\
\dot{y} &= V\sin{\delta} \\
\delta &= constant
\end{align*}
:::

For a fixed time $t_f$ the the final distance in the x-direction (X) is defined as:

:::{math}
X = V \cos{\delta}t_f
:::

So that the optimal control law will be:

:::{math}   
\cos{\delta} = \frac{X}{V t_f}
:::

If you were to draw this, all the boat is doing is moving at a constant bearing if you were to maximize $y\left(t_f\right)$ you'll want to move at 45 degree angle.
