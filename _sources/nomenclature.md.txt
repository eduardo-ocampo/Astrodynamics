Vector Notation
To make the Latex rendering easier to read, vectors are denoted in bold. For example position vector is typically thought as $\vec{r}$ in this documentation it a vector will be denoted as $\mathbf{r}$.

:::{math}
:label:
\vec{r} \equiv \mathbf{r}
:::

Define the general relative vector notation as.

:::{math}
:label:
\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i
:::

For example

:::{math}
\mathbf{r}_{12} = \mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1
